#### Airgead Banking App
One of the projects I've worked on is the "Airgead_Banking_App". This command-line software calculates compound interest with monthly contributions. The program will first ask for 4 values which are initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years investment will be in effect. The program will then display the yearly balance for the number of years you specify.

What I found fairly challenging was how to properly implement the calculation. A lot of the information I found on the web was disconnected and too general. The two formulas that are required to implement the calculation are "A = P(1 + r/n)" and "((PMT(1 + r/n)^nt - 1) / r/n)". The second formula is only used to calculate compound interest when there is a monthly contribution involved.
