#### Grocery-Tracking Program
This command-line application organizes and displays the purchase frequency of grocery items. This is useful to help visualize what items have been sold and what needs restocking. I think I implemented the histogram quite nicely. The histogram has been formatted to clearly show purchase frequency of items. In order to group items, I used a method that copies the second item in front of the first and deletes the second. The swap function could have been used instead which probably would not have increased the execution speed, but it would have used less code. Creating a way to count the number of each item was the most challenging part. The code was ultimately simple enough to where it did not need any special tools or libraries. Which also makes it maintainable. C++ is a commonly used language and so makes what is learned here transferable to real world applications.
